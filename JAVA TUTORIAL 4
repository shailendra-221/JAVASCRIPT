Arithmetic Operations
A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers.

The two numbers can be literals:

Example
let x = 100 + 50;
or variables:

Example
let x = a + b;
or expressions:

Example
let x = (100 + 50) * a;
Operators and Operands
The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.

The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.

Adding
The addition operator (+) adds numbers:

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
Subtracting
The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers.

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x - y;
Multiplying
The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;
Dividing
The division operator (/) divides numbers.

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x / y;
